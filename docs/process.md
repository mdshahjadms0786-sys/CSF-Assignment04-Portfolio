# Development Process

## 1. Planning Phase
Before writing code, I planned the following:
- A simple and clean layout  
- Sections required for a portfolio  
- Proper folder structure  
- Using only HTML & CSS (no JavaScript)

## 2. Setup Phase
### Folder Setup in VS Code
- Created main folder **CSF-Assignment04-Portfolio**
- Added:
  - index.html  
  - style.css  
  - images/ folder  
  - docs/ folder

### Git Setup

## 3. Development Phase
